For printing the desired model you run the skinning_test_main.py file.
Make sure, when you create a Skinned Mesh object, that you have changed the filename to the one that corresponds to the desirable animation file path fromn your machine.
If you run the unittest (test_SkinnedMesh.py) make sure you have changed the filename there as well.
