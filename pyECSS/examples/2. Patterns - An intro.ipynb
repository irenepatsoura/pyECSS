    "[Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem__\n",
    "Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.\n",
    "For example, imagine that you have two types of objects: Products and Boxes . A Box can contain several Products as well as a number of smaller Boxes . These little Boxes can also hold some Products or even smaller Boxes , and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you decide to create an ordering system that uses these classes. Orders could contain simple products without any wrapping, as well as boxes stuffed with products...and other boxes. How would you determine the total price of such an order?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could try the direct approach: unwrap all the boxes, go over all the products and then calculate the total. That would be doable in the real world; but in a program, it’s not as simple as running a loop. You have to know the classes of Products and Boxes you’re going through, the nesting level of the boxes and other nasty details beforehand. All of this makes the direct approach either too awkward or even impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__\n",
    "The Composite pattern suggests that you work with Products and Boxes through a common interface which declares a method for calculating the total price.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would this method work? For a product, it’d simply return the product’s price. For a box, it’d go over each item the box contains, ask its price and then return a total for this box. If one of these items were a smaller box, that box would also start going over its contents and so on, until the prices of all inner components were calculated. A box could even add some extra cost to the final price, such as packaging cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Composite pattern lets you run a behavior recursively over all components of an object tree.\n",
    "The greatest benefit of this approach is that you don’t need to care about the concrete classes of objects that compose the tree. You don’t need to know whether an object is a simple product or a sophisticated box. You can treat them all the same via the common interface. When you call a method, the objects themselves pass the request down the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Composite Pattern Structure](./Files_for_notebooks/composite_pattern.png)\n",
    "1. The Component interface describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree.\n",
    "2. The Leaf is a basic element of a tree that doesn’t have sub-elements. Usually, leaf components end up doing most of the real work, since they don’t have anyone to delegate the work to.\n",
    "3. The Container (aka composite) is an element that has sub-elements: leaves or other containers. A container doesn’t know the concrete classes of its children. It works with all sub-elements only via the component interface. Upon receiving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns the final result to the client.\n",
    "4. The Client works with all elements through the component interface. As a result, the client can work in the same way with both simple or complex elements of the tree.\n",

    "### 2.2 Iterator Pattern <a class=\"anchor\" id='Iterator'></a>\n",
    "[Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem__\n",
    "Collections are one of the most used data types in programming. Nonetheless, a collection is just a container for a group of objects. Most collections store their elements in simple lists. However, some of them are based on stacks, trees, graphs and other complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no matter how a collection is structured, it must provide some way of accessing its elements so that other code can use these elements. There should be a way to go through each element of the collection without accessing the same elements over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound like an easy job if you have a collection based on a list. You just loop over all of the elements. But how do you sequentially traverse elements of a complex data structure, such as a tree? For example, one day you might be just fine with depth-first traversal of a tree. Yet the next day you might require breadth-first traversal. And the next week, you might need something else, like random access to the tree elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding more and more traversal algorithms to the collection gradually blurs its primary responsibility, which is efficient data storage. Additionally, some algorithms might be tailored for a specific application, so including them into a generic collection class would be weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the client code that’s supposed to work with various collections may not even care how they store their elements. However, since collections all provide different ways of accessing their elements, you have no option other than to couple your code to the specific collection classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__\n",
    "The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing the algorithm itself, an iterator object encapsulates all of the traversal details, such as the current position and how many elements are left till the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, several iterators can go through the same collection at the same time, independently of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, iterators provide one primary method for fetching elements of the collection. The client can keep running this method until it doesn’t return anything, which means that the iterator has traversed all of the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "All iterators must implement the same interface. This makes the client code compatible with any collection type or any traversal algorithm as long as there’s a proper iterator. If you need a special way to traverse a collection, you just create a new iterator class, without having to change the collection or the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Iterator Pattern Structure](./Files_for_notebooks/iterator_pattern.png)\n",
    "1. The Iterator interface declares the operations required for traversing a collection: fetching the next element, retrieving the current position, restarting iteration, etc.\n",
    "2. Concrete Iterators implement specific algorithms for traversing a collection. The iterator object should track the traversal progress on its own. This allows several iterators to traverse the same collection independently of each other.\n",
    "3. The Collection interface declares one or multiple methods for getting iterators compatible with the collection. Note that the return type of the methods must be declared as the iterator interface so that the concrete collections can return various kinds of iterators.\n",
    "4. Concrete Collections return new instances of a particular concrete iterator class each time the client requests one. You might be wondering, where’s the rest of the collection’s code? Don’t worry, it should be in the same class. It’s just that these details aren’t crucial to the actual pattern, so we’re omitting them.\n",
    "5. The Client works with both collections and iterators via their interfaces. This way the client isn’t coupled to concrete classes, allowing you to use various collections and iterators with the same client code.Typically, clients don’t create iterators on their own, but instead get them from collections. Yet, in certain cases, the client can create one directly; for example, when the client defines its own special iterator.\n",

    "### 2.3 Visitor Pattern <a class=\"anchor\" id='Visitor'></a>\n",
    "[Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem__\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that your team develops an app which works with geographic information structured as one colossal graph. Each node of the graph may represent a complex entity such as a city, but also more granular things like industries, sightseeing areas, etc. The nodes are connected with others if there’s a road between the real objects that they represent. Under the hood, each node type is represented by its own class, while each specific node is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, you got a task to implement exporting the graph into XML format. At first, the job seemed pretty straightforward. You planned to add an export method to each node class and then leverage recursion to go over each node of the graph, executing the export method. The solution was simple and elegant: thanks to polymorphism, you weren’t coupling the code which called the export method to concrete classes of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the system architect refused to allow you to alter existing node classes. He said that the code was already in production and he didn’t want to risk breaking it because of a potential bug in your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, he questioned whether it makes sense to have the XML export code within the node classes. The primary job of these classes was to work with geodata. The XML export behavior would look alien there.\n",
    "There was another reason for the refusal. It was highly likely that after this feature was implemented, someone from the marketing department would ask you to provide the ability to export into a different format, or request some other weird stuff. This would force you to change those precious and fragile classes again.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called visitor, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitor’s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if that behavior can be executed over objects of different classes? For example, in our case with XML export, the actual implementation will probably be a little bit different across various node classes. Thus, the visitor class may define not one, but a set of methods, each of which could take arguments of different types, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`class ExportVisitor implements Visitor is\n",
    "    method doForCity(City c) { ... }\n",
    "    method doForIndustry(Industry f) { ... } \n",
    "    method doForSightSeeing(SightSeeing ss) { ... } \n",
    "    //... `\n",
    "\n",
    "But how exactly would we call these methods, especially when dealing with the whole graph? These methods have different signatures, so we can’t use polymorphism. To pick a proper visitor method that’s able to process a given object, we’d need to check its class. Doesn’t this sound like a nightmare?\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "foreach (Node node in graph) {\n",
    "    if (node instanceof City)\n",
    "        exportVisitor.doForCity((City) node) \n",
    "    if (node instanceof Industry)\n",
    "        exportVisitor.doForIndustry((Industry) node) \n",
    "    //...\n",
    "}\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask, why don’t we use method overloading? That’s when you give all methods the same name, even if they support different sets of parameters. Unfortunately, even assuming that our programming language supports it at all (as Java and C# do), it won’t help us. Since the exact class of a node object is unknown in advance, the overloading mechanism won’t be able to determine the correct method to execute. It’ll default to the method that takes an object of the base Node\n",
    "class.\n",
    "However, the Visitor pattern addresses this problem. It uses a technique called Double Dispatch, which helps to execute the proper method on an object without cumbersome conditionals. Instead of letting the client select a proper version of the method to call, how about we delegate this choice to objects we’re passing to the visitor as an argument?\n",
    "Since the objects know their own classes, they’ll be able to pick a proper method on the visitor less awkwardly. They “accept” a visitor and tell it what visiting method should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`// Client code\n",
    "foreach (Node node in graph) \n",
    "    node.accept(exportVisitor)\n",
    "// City\n",
    "class City is\n",
    "    method accept(Visitor v) is\n",
    "        v.doForCity(this) \n",
    "    //...\n",
    "// Industry\n",

    "        v.doForIndustry(this) \n",
    "    // ...`\n",
    "\n",
    "I confess. We had to change the node classes after all. But at least the change is trivial and it lets us add further behaviors without altering the code once again.\n",
    "Now, if we extract a common interface for all visitors, all existing nodes can work with any visitor you introduce into the app. If you find yourself introducing a new behavior related to nodes, all you have to do is implement a new visitor class.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Visitor Pattern Structure](./Files_for_notebooks/visitor_pattern.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Visitor interface declares a set of visiting methods that can take concrete elements of an object structure as arguments. These methods may have the same names if the program is written in a language that supports overloading, but the type of their parameters must be different.\n",
    "2. Each Concrete Visitor implements several versions of the same behaviors, tailored for different concrete element classes.\n",
    "3. The Element interface declares a method for “accepting” visitors. This method should have one parameter declared with the type of the visitor interface.\n",
    "4. Each Concrete Element must implement the acceptance method. The purpose of this method is to redirect the call to the proper visitor’s method corresponding to the current element class. Be aware that even if a base element class implements this method, all subclasses must still override this method in their own classes and call the appropriate method on the visitor object.\n",
    "5. The Client usually represents a collection or some other complex object. Usually, clients aren’t aware of all the concrete element classes because they work with objects from that collection via some abstract interface.\n",

    "Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework. Ordinarily, you’d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on.\n",
    "\n",

    "__Solution__\n",
    "\n",
    "A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.\n",
    "Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality. For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format) . After creating such a class and connecting it with the video conversion library, you’ll have your first facade.\n",

    "2. An Additional Facade class can be created to prevent polluting a single facade with unrelated features that might make it yet another complex structure. Additional facades can be used by both clients and other facades.\n",
    "3. The Complex Subsystem consists of dozens of various objects. To make them all do something meaningful, you have to dive deep into the subsystem’s implementation details, such as initializing objects in the correct order and supplying them with data in the proper format.

    "The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface, which declares a method called deliver . Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships.\n",

You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type. Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers.\n",

    "Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.\n",

    "__Problem__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:\n",
    "1. Ensure that a class has just a single instance. Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource — for example, a database or a file.\n",
    "Here’s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created.\n",
    "Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call must always return a new object by design.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide a global access point to that instance. Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While they’re very handy, they’re also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.\n",
    "Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.\n",
    "There’s another side to this problem: you don’t want the code that solves problem 1 to be scattered all over your program. It’s much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.\n",

    "The initial version of the library was based on the Notifier class that had only a few fields, a constructor and a single send method.Themethodcouldacceptamessageargument from a client and send the message to a list of emails that were passed to the notifier via its constructor. A third-party app which acted as a client was supposed to create and configure the notifier object once, and then use it each time something important happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, you realize that users of the library expect more than just email notifications. Many of them would like to receive an SMS about critical issues. Others would like to be notified on Facebook and, of course, the corporate users would love to get Slack notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "How hard can that be? You extended the Notifier class and put the additional notification methods into new subclasses. Now the client was supposed to instantiate the desired notification class and use it for all further notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then someone reasonably asked you, “Why can’t you use several notification types at once? If your house is on fire, you’d probably want to be informed through every channel.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You tried to address that problem by creating special subclasses which combined several notification methods within one class. However, it quickly became apparent that this approach would bloat the code immensely, not only the library code but the client code as well. You have to find some other way to structure notifications classes so that their number won’t accidentally break some Guinness record.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending a class is the first thing that comes to mind when you need to alter an object’s behavior. However, inheritance has several serious caveats that you need to be aware of.\n",
    "* Inheritance is static. You can’t alter the behavior of an existing object at runtime. You can only replace the whole object with another one that’s created from a different subclass.\n",
    "* Subclasses can have just one parent class. In most languages, inheritance doesn’t let a class inherit behaviors of multiple classes at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to overcome these caveats is by using Aggregation or Composition instead of Inheritance \n",
    "(_Aggregation_: object A contains objects B; B can live without A. _Composition_: object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle of B; B can’t live without A.). Both of the alternatives work almost the same way: one object has a reference to another and delegates it some work, whereas with inheritance, the object itself is able to do that work, inheriting the\n",
    "behavior from its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this new approach you can easily substitute the linked “helper” object with another, changing the behavior of the container at runtime. An object can use the behavior of various classes, having references to multiple objects and delegating them all kinds of work. Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind many design patterns, including Decorator. On that note, let’s return to the pattern discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Wrapper” is the alternative nickname for the Decorator pattern that clearly expresses the main idea of the pattern. A wrapper is an object that can be linked with some target object. The wrapper contains the same set of methods as the target and delegates to it all requests it receives. However, the wrapper may alter the result by doing something either before or after it passes the request to the target.\n",
    "When does a simple wrapper become the real decorator? As I mentioned, the wrapper implements the same interface as the wrapped object. That’s why from the client’s perspective these objects are identical. Make the wrapper’s reference field accept any object that follows that interface. This will let you cover an object in multiple wrappers, adding the combined behavior of all the wrappers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our notifications example, let’s leave the simple email notification behavior inside the base Notifier class, but turn all other notification methods into decorators. The client code would need to wrap a basic notifier object into a set of decorators that match the client’s preferences. The resulting objects will be structured as a stack.\n",
    "The last decorator in the stack would be the object that the client actually works with. Since all decorators implement the same interface as the base notifier, the rest of the client code won’t care whether it works with the “pure” notifier object or the decorated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could apply the same approach to other behaviors such as formatting messages or composing the recipient list. The client can decorate the object with any custom decorators, as long as they follow the same interface as the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decorator Pattern Structure](./Files_for_notebooks/decorator_pattern.png)\n",
    "1. The Component declares the common interface for both wrappers and wrapped objects.\n",
    "2. Concrete Component is a class of objects being wrapped. It defines the basic behavior, which can be altered by decorators.\n",
    "3. The Base Decorator class has a field for referencing a wrapped object. The field’s type should be declared as the component interface so it can contain both concrete components and decorators. The base decorator delegates all operations to the wrapped object.\n",
    "4. Concrete Decorators define extra behaviors that can be added to components dynamically. Concrete decorators override methods of the base decorator and execute their behavior either before or after calling the parent method.\n",
    "5. The Client can wrap components in multiple layers of decorators, as long as it works with all objects via the component interface.\n",

    "[Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem__\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have two types of objects: a Customer and a Store . The customer is very interested in a particular brand of product (say, it’s a new model of the iPhone) which should\n",
    "become available in the store very soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer could visit the store every day and check product availability. But while the product is still en route, most of these trips would be pointless.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the store could send tons of emails (which might be considered spam) to all customers each time a new product becomes available. This would save some customers from endless trips to the store. At the same time, it’d upset other customers who aren’t interested in new products.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like we’ve got a conflict. Either the customer wastes time checking product availability or the store wastes resources notifying the wrong customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__\n",
    "\n",
    "The object that has some interesting state is often called subject, but since it’s also going to notify other objects about the changes to its state, we’ll call it publisher. All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher’s state are called subscribers.\n",
    "The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. Fear not! Everything isn’t as complicated as it sounds. In reality, this mechanism consists of 1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects and 2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever an important event happens to the publisher, it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects.\n",
    "Real apps might have dozens of different subscriber classes that are interested in tracking events of the same publisher class. You wouldn’t want to couple the publisher to all of those classes. Besides, you might not even know about some of them beforehand if your publisher class is supposed to be used by other people.\n",
    "That’s why it’s crucial that all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your app has several different types of publishers and you want to make your subscribers compatible with all of them, you can go even further and make all publishers follow the same interface. This interface would only need to describe a few subscription methods. The interface would allow subscribers to observe publishers’ states without coupling to their concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Observer Pattern Structure](./Files_for_notebooks/observer_pattern.png)\n",
    "1. The Publisher issues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publishers contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave the list.\n",
    "2. When a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object.\n",
    "3. The Subscriber interface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of a single update method. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update.\n",
    "4. Concrete Subscribers perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn’t coupled to concrete classes.\n",
    "5. Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.\n",
    "6. The Client creates publisher and subscriber objects separately and then registers subscribers for publisher updates.\n",

    "### 2.9 Mediator Pattern <a class=\"anchor\" id='Mediator'></a> \n",
    "[Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem__\n",
    "Say you have a dialog for creating and editing customer profiles. It consists of various form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, buttons, etc.\n",
    " Relations between elements of the user interface can become chaotic as the application evolves.\n",
    "Some of the form elements may interact with others. For instance, selecting the “I have a dog” checkbox may reveal a hidden text field for entering the dog’s name. Another example is the submit button that has to validate values of all fields before saving the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having this logic implemented directly inside the code of the form elements you make these elements’ classes much harder to reuse in other forms of the app. For example, you won’t be able to use that checkbox class inside another form, because it’s coupled to the dog’s text field. You can use either all the classes involved in rendering the profile form, or none at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example with the profile editing form, the dialog class itself may act as the mediator. Most likely, the dialog class is already aware of all of its sub-elements, so you won’t even need to introduce new dependencies into this class.\n",
    "The most significant change happens to the actual form elements. Let’s consider the submit button. Previously, each time a user clicked the button, it had to validate the values of all individual form elements. Now its single job is to notify the dialog about the click. Upon receiving this notification, the dialog itself performs the validations or passes the task to the individual elements. Thus, instead of being tied to a dozen form elements, the button is only dependent on the dialog class.\n",
    "You can go further and make the dependency even looser by extracting the common interface for all types of dialogs. The interface would declare the notification method which all form elements can use to notify the dialog about events happening to those elements. Thus, our submit button should now be able to work with any dialog that implements that interface.\n",
    "This way, the Mediator pattern lets you encapsulate a complex web of relations between various objects inside a single mediator object. The fewer dependencies a class has, the easier it becomes to modify, extend or reuse that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mediator Pattern Structure](./Files_for_notebooks/mediator_pattern.png)\n",
    "1. Components are various classes that contain some business logic. Each component has a reference to a mediator, declared with the type of the mediator interface. The component isn’t aware of the actual class of the mediator, so you can reuse the component in other programs by linking it to a different mediator.\n",
    "2. The Mediator interface declares methods of communication with components, which usually include just a single notification method. Components may pass any context as arguments of this method, including their own objects, but only in such a way that no coupling occurs between a receiving component and the sender’s class.\n",
    "3. Concrete Mediators encapsulate relations between various components. Concrete mediators often keep references to all components they manage and sometimes even manage their lifecycle.\n",
    "4. Components must not be aware of other components. If something important happens within or to a component, it must only notify the mediator. When the mediator receives the notification, it can easily identify the sender, which might be just enough to decide what component should be triggered in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a component’s perspective, it all looks like a total black box. The sender doesn’t know who’ll end up handling its request, and the receiver doesn’t know who sent the request in the first place.\n",
