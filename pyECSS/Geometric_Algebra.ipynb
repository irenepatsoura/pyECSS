    "A rotation matrix can be defined as a transformation matrix that operates on a vector and produces a rotated vector such that the coordinate axes always remain fixed. These matrices rotate a vector in the counterclockwise direction by an angle θ. A rotation matrix is always a square matrix with real entities. This implies that it will always have an equal number of rows and columns. Moreover, rotation matrices are orthogonal matrices with a determinant equal to 1.\n",

    "Dual quaternions are an 8-dimensional real algebra isomorphic to the tensor product of the quaternions and the dual numbers. Thus, they may be constructed in the same way as the quaternions, except using dual numbers instead of real numbers as coefficients. A dual quaternion can be represented in the form A + εB, where A and B are ordinary quaternions and ε is the dual unit, which satisfies ε2 = 0 and commutes with every element of the algebra. Similar to the way that rotations in 3d space can be represented by quaternions of unit length, rigid motions in 3d space can be represented by dual quaternions of unit length. Rigid transformations, can be each represented with eight scalar variables, and combined through concatenation. Smooth constant interpolation between two rigid transformations can also be achieved effortlessly using Dual quaternion algebra.\n",

    "In multilinear algebra, a multivector or Clifford number is an element of the exterior algebra on a vector space, Λ*V. This algebra consists of linear combinations of simple k-vectors \"Multivector\" may mean either homogeneous elements, which are referred to as k-vectors or p-vectors, or may allow sums of terms in different degrees. The k-th exterior power, is the vector space of formal sums of k-multivectors. The product of a k-multivector and an ℓ-multivector is a-multivector. So, the direct sum forms an associative algebra, which is closed with respect to the wedge product. This algebra, commonly denoted by Λ, is called the exterior algebra of V. In differential geometry, a p-vector is the tensor obtained by taking linear combinations of the wedge product of p tangent vectors, for some integer p ≥ 0. It is the dual concept to a p-form. For p = 0, 1, 2 and 3, these are often called respectively scalars, vectors, bivectors and trivectors; they are respectively dual to 0-forms, 1-forms, 2-forms and 3-forms.\n",

    "Homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, just as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. If homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point. Since homogeneous coordinates are also given to points at infinity, the number of coordinates required to allow this extension is one more than the dimension of the projective space being considered.\n",
